notes 

consider list 

[1 2 '3' 4 5]
 
 user gives position 2

p points to 1 when count = 0;
when p points to 2 count = 1;
when p point to 3 count = 2

now loop stops

now 2' next should point to new node
3's previous should point to new node
new node's next should point to 3
and new node's previous should point to 2

Here we also need to handle cases
if the list is empty it would simple return
